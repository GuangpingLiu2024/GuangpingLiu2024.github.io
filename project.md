Welcome to my engineering journey, showcased through this unique collection of projects. Each one reflects the skills I've honed and the knowledge gained, marking my growth in this dynamic field. Let's explore this realm of creativity and precision together.

## MATLAB App for treadmills: COM tracking and self-pacing control
{% include treadmill.html id="WSWWkngDGDg" %}

The project revolved around the development of a force-instrumented treadmill designed to self-regulate and match an individual's walking or running pace. It simplifies access to locomotion data and assists researchers in conducting cost-effective and efficient studies in the fields of human gait and rehabilitation. During this project, I built a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate communication with the treadmill, implemented a self-pacing algorithm to control its speed, and designed a kinetic model to estimate the lateral Center of Mass (COM) movement. By comparing with practical data derived from Motion Capture Systems in pilot experiments, the model provided highly accurate estimations. Additionally, the project involved about diverse knowledge areas, including hardware communication protocols, software management, and control methods.

## Turtlebot-based SLAM and April Tag Detection

The video showcased above presents our final project for the Mobile Robotics course at Northeastern University. We ustilized a Turtlebot3 for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to explore and map an unknown environment, pinpoint the robot's position, and detect AprilTags using a specialized detection scheme. This project extensively leveraged the Robot Operating System (ROS) alongside off-shelf packages and custom Python scripts, leading to an in-depth understanding of ROS and its applications.

Q-Learning is an off-policy value-based method that uses a TD approach to train its action-value function. In this project, I implement Q-Learning with some libraries to train a model. In this model, our "hero" needs to avoid pools and find a way to the get the gift. Keep an eye on my study on DQL. 

## Feature Attribution in Predicting Survival on the Titanic

In this machine learning project, we utilized the Titanic passengers' dataset to construct a predictive model for survival, exploring various modeling strategies, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. Additionally, driven by an analysis of failure models and a curiosity about feature importance, which could optimize model performance while using fewer features, I utilized the Integrated Gradient and Pytorch framework to estimate the importance of each feature, thereby identifying the most influential attributes within the dataset.

The project involves embedded programming with a DC motor using Arduino and Simulink. In it, I employed feedback control coupled with a proportional controller(PD) to manage the motor's velocities and positions.

## A Multi-functional Stroller

A Multi-functional Stroller is a comprehensive design to provide a solution for parents to take care of their children. Leveraging the capabilities of SolidWorks, this project dived into the detailed design process, generated accurate assembly drawings, and simulated the movement of the stroller using SolidWorks Motion Simulation.

This project introduces an innovative parking solution designed to maximize space efficiency in community settings. It features a parking machine that elevates vehicles to a second-floor parking area, thereby allowing the ground level to be utilized for additional parking. This dual-level arrangement optimizes space usage and significantly enhances parking capacity. It won the first prize in 8th Mechanical Innovative Design Competition for National College Student in China.
