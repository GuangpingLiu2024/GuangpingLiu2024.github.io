## WheelArm-Sim
{% include wheelarm_sim.html id="m4w6PAx8fN8" %}
Although recent advancements in assistive robotics have focused on Wheelchair-Mounted Robot Manipulators (WMRMs), integrated and intuitive control of both the wheelchair and robot arm remains significantly underexplored. Therefore, we introduce WheelArm, a cyber-physical system (CPS) that integrates wheelchair and robotic arm control. This work presents WheelArm-Sim, a simulation framework developed in Isaac Sim for synthetic data collection, which includes an indoor simulation environment and a ROS2-based data collection workflow. A small multimodal dataset has been collected and will be published in the future. In this video, we demonstrate the data collection process using WheelArm-Sim.



## MATLAB App for treadmills: COM tracking and self-pacing control(Past Research)
{% include treadmill.html id="WSWWkngDGDg" %}

The project develops a force-instrumented self-pacing treadmill Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Matlab to match individuals' walking or running pace. It simplifies access to force-plate data and assists researchers in conducting cost-effective and efficient studies in the fields of human gait and rehabilitation. During this project, a GUI is built to facilitate communication with the treadmill, implemented a self-pacing algorithm to control its speed, and designed a kinetic model to estimate the lateral Center of Mass (COM) movement in walkding. By comparing with practical data derived from Motion Capture Systems in pilot experiments, the model provided highly accurate estimations.

<!-- ## Turtlebot-based SLAM and April Tag Detection
{% include turtlebot.html id="lUepFLHuZ8g" %}

The video showcased above presents our final project for the Mobile Robotics course at Northeastern University. We utilized a Turtlebot3 for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to explore and map an unknown environment, pinpoint the robot's position, and detect AprilTags using a specialized detection scheme. This project extensively leveraged the Robot Operating System (ROS) alongside off-shelf packages and custom Python scripts, leading to an in-depth understanding of ROS and its applications.

Q-Learning is an off-policy value-based method that uses a TD approach to train its action-value function. In this project, I implement Q-Learning with some libraries to train a model. In this model, our "hero" needs to avoid pools and find a way to the get the gift. Keep an eye on my study on DQL.

In this machine learning project, we utilized the Titanic passengers' dataset to construct a predictive model for survival, exploring various modeling strategies, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. Additionally, driven by an analysis of failure models and a curiosity about feature importance, which could optimize model performance while using fewer features, I utilized the Integrated Gradient and Pytorch framework to estimate the importance of each feature, thereby identifying the most influential attributes within the dataset.

A Multi-functional Stroller is a comprehensive design to provide a solution for parents to take care of their children. Leveraging the capabilities of SolidWorks, this project dived into the detailed design process, generated accurate assembly drawings, and simulated the movement of the stroller using SolidWorks Motion Simulation.

This project introduces an innovative parking solution designed to maximize space efficiency in community settings. It features a parking machine that elevates vehicles to a second-floor parking area, thereby allowing the ground level to be utilized for additional parking. This dual-level arrangement optimizes space usage and significantly enhances parking capacity. It won the first prize in 8th Mechanical Innovative Design Competition for National College Student in China. -->
