Welcome to my engineering journey, showcased through this unique collection of projects. Each one reflects the skills I've honed and the knowledge gained, marking my growth in this dynamic field. Let's explore this realm of creativity and precision together.

## MATLAB App for treadmills: COM tracking and self-pacing control
{% include treadmill.html id="WSWWkngDGDg" %}

This project revolves around designing a software-integrated, force-instrumented treadmill that self-regulates to match an individual's walking or running pace. This advancement simplifies access to locomotion data, aiding researchers in conducting cost-effective and efficient studies. The instrumented treadmill interfaces with MATLAB for real-time data collection from two force plates and treadmill speed control. I developed a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that not only implements the self-pacing algorithm but also facilitates data stream analysis, delivering crucial information such as Center of Position (COP) and Center of Mass (COM). It also amalgamates diverse knowledge areas including hardware communication protocols, software management, close loop control and kalman filter.

## Turtlebot-based SLAM and April Tag Detection

The video showcased above presents our final project for the Mobile Robotics course at Northeastern University. We harnessed the capabilities of a Turtlebot3 for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to explore and map an unfamiliar environment, pinpoint the robot's position, and detect tags using a specialized detection scheme. This project extensively leveraged the Robot Operating System (ROS) alongside ready-made packages and custom Python scripts, facilitating an in-depth understanding of ROS and its applications.

Q-Learning is an off-policy value-based method that uses a TD approach to train its action-value function. In this project, I implement Q-Learning with some libraries to train a model. In this model, our "hero" needs to avoid pools and find a way to the get the gift. Keep an eye on my study on DQL.

In this machine learning project, we harnessed the Titanic passengers' data set to construct a predictive model for survival. We explored various modeling strategies, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. Moreover, we delved deeper into feature importance, utilizing feature attribution to identify the most influential attributes within the data set.

A Multi-functional Stroller is a comprehensive design to provide a solution for parents to take care of their children. Leveraging the capabilities of SolidWorks, this project dived into the detailed design process, generated accurate assembly drawings, and simulated the movement of the stroller using SolidWorks Motion Simulation.

This project introduces an innovative parking solution designed to maximize space efficiency in community settings. It features a parking machine that elevates vehicles to a second-floor parking area, thereby allowing the ground level to be utilized for additional parking. This dual-level arrangement optimizes space usage and significantly enhances parking capacity. It won the first prize in 8th Mechanical Innovative Design Competition for National College Student in China.
