This project revolves around designing a software-integrated, force-instrumented treadmill that self-regulates to match an individual's walking or running pace. This advancement simplifies access to locomotion data, aiding researchers in conducting cost-effective and efficient studies. The instrumented treadmill interfaces with MATLAB for real-time data collection from two force plates and treadmill speed control. I developed a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) that not only implements the self-pacing algorithm but also facilitates data stream analysis, delivering crucial information such as Center of Position (COP) and Center of Mass (COM). It also amalgamates diverse knowledge areas including hardware communication protocols, software management, and model construction.
